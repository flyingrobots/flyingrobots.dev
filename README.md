# flyingrobots.dev

I needed a place to put things. So I built it.

This repo contains the code for my personal website. It may also contain:
- Projects I actually finished
- Thoughts I regret writing publicly
- Side quests I never meant to ship
- Code that looked clever at 2am

If it works, great. If it doesnâ€™t, I meant it that way.
